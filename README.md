### **General info**
This game is about guessing the average amount of dots on 3 dices after throwing them as many times as the players want.
Players put their names and the subjects to bet on. They also put the numbers of walls (so also the dots) that dices have and how many times they will be thrown. After that the players bet on the result - the smallest number they can bet is of course 3 (3 dices, and on each result-wall with 1 dot). Maximum number to bet is the sum of all the walls (=dots) of these 3 dices. The winner is the one whose guess is closer to the result of throwing the dices.
